                            THE INSIGHT:
                        <br />
                            Like other countries around the world, Malaysians hold football in the highest esteem. During the football season,
                            multitudes will hang out at their favourite 'mamak’s and restaurants to catch the game, and give a shout of jubilation
                            when a goal is scored.
                            
                            As the official technology partner of FC Barcelona, INTEL will enable the club to be one of the most technologically
                            advanced soccer clubs in the world.
                            
                            AND with Brazil 2014 just around the corner, the timing couldn’t be better for INTEL to push forth a Football-related
                            initiative.
                            
                            So how do we get this off the ground?
                            <br />

                            THE IDEA: <br />
                            Introducing The Great Pre-Cup Fever.
                            
                            Leveraging on the pre-world cup buzz, we organised the first-of-its-kind cross-platform futsal tournament requiring
                            participants to be actively involved online with their fan base and on ground for more winning chances!

                            THE IDEA:
                            <br />
                            To promote MAGGI’s range of concentrated liquid stock and increase engagement on MAGGI Singapore’s Facebook page, we
                            created a fun, cheeky app that encourages users to frequently visit and share the page with their friends.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <hr />
                            HOW DOES IT WORK? <br />
                            To participate, users are required to ‘like’ the MAGGI Singapore Facebook page. They then get to select their preferred
                            stock to “invest” in. Once they earn a share in their chosen stock, they need to earn more shares by sharing the app
                            with up to 10 friends per day. Each time a friend earns a share, the user gets a share too.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The value of a user’s chosen stock may also rise or fall throughout the duration of the campaign, depending on the
                            latest events reported in the Market Buzz daily. These events are written in a witty, entertaining manner to keep users
                            interested.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            For example:
                            “105-YEAR OLD’S SECRET TO LONGEVITY REVEALED! Local 105-year old man credits his long life to being vegetarian. MAGGI
                            Concentrated Vegetarian Stock shares rise as more and more people start following the vegetarian route.”
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            By the end of the campaign period, users will be rewarded with a cash voucher, with its value determined by the amount
                            of shares accumulated.

                                Lactacyd feminine hygiene wash is formulated to help maintain the natural pH of a woman’s intimate area. As an emotional
                                connection to the brand, we promote that a complete beauty regime with Lactacyd makes a woman more confident and bold to
                                take on any challenge ahead of her.
                                <br />

                                THE IDEA: <br />
                                As part of a year-long campaign to expand the brand’s digital presence, we developed a simple yet engaging online game
                                as a contest to reward 6 loyal Lactacyd users with an exhilarating dream experience. Combining the insight with a play
                                on the word “pH”, the “Bold pHantasies” contest was born.

                            According to the Chinese calendar, year 2014 was the Year of the Horse. As we wanted our beloved colleagues at Publicis
                            to usher in the Chinese New Year with an abundance of fun and prosperity, we created a horse racing game – a game that
                            allows fellow colleagues to place “bets” on a horse and stand a chance to win exciting gift vouchers.
                            <br />

                            THE IDEA: <br />
                            We called it the “Ma Race 2014”, as the word “ma” stands for “horse” in the Chinese language.
                            <br /> <br />
                            6 racehorses were created, each with a personalised name and winning character – written in a humorous and quirky tone.
                            Every day (for a period of one week) before the race is played out on the communal TV, employees in Publicis are
                            required to place their bets by either scanning the QR code of his/her chosen horse or by logging in to the game
                            microsite to do so.
                            <br /><br />
                            With 100 “kam"s ("kam” = Mandarin orange/gold in Chinese) as chips to bet on their favourite horses, participants must
                            accumulate as many "kam"s as possible by the end of the week in order to be the Top 3 winners.
